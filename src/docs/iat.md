# IAT(Implicit Association Test)
---------------------------------
A list of images or HTML-formatted content is given as the stimulus. There are two or more labels associated with each stimulus and two different key presses associated with the labels. For example, you would press 'f' for the right category lable and 'j' for the left category lable. Throughout the experiment, data will be collected such as the number of correct key presses, the time it takes to get a response, etc. 

For a better understanding, you can look at the documentation here: https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/blob/master/docs/markdown_docs/plugins/jspsych-iat-html.md
